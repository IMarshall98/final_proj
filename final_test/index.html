                    This app will help users sort through the  LitterTRAK API  which tracks the litter collection in PG County. The main information that the dataset provides information, such as the amount and type of trash, the location, the watershed that would've likely been affected by the trash,  and who cleaned it up. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will make it easier to identify common “problem areas”, meaning areas that are particularly close to watersheds and frequently have large amounts of litter to be picked up. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use this site to keep track of your “Adopt-a-road” location, find areas to clean up for a service project, and educate yourselves and others about what watersheds your trash could be affecting.
