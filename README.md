Final Project for INST 377 (LitterTrak API)

## PG County Litter

Our project is intended to visualize the litter problem throughout PG County, Maryland using a map with points that represent litter (furniture, bed frames, trash bags with trash in them, and other forms of litter). This could be used for people who want to see which areas of PG County have litter problems and want to help clean the area up.
