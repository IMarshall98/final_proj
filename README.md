Final Project for INST 377 (LitterTrak API)

## PG County Litter

Our project is titled LitterTrak. This app serves to make the information from the LitterTrak API more  clear and manageable. It will provide the amount and type of trash, the location, the watershed that wouldâ€™ve  likely been affected by the trash,  and who cleaned it up. Our app can be found at https://github.com/IMarshall98/final_proj
In terms of target browsers, we aimed to make the app as widely usable as possible. To do this we aimed primarily at desktop based web browsers like google chrome and microsoft edge. We intended the app to be usable on mobile devices as well given that this is where most internet activity takes place in the current day. We decided to focus more on safari browsers for  IOS devices over android.

Our project is intended to visualize the litter problem throughout PG County, Maryland using a map with points that represent litter (furniture, bed frames, trash bags with trash in them, and other forms of litter). This could be used for people who want to see which areas of PG County have litter problems and want to help clean the area up.
